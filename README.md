# Formula-1-Data-Engineering-Project-Using-Azure-Databricks

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a data pipeline to process and analyze Formula 1 race data using Azure Databricks. The goal is to create an end-to-end solution that ingests data, performs transformations, and prepares it for analysis and reporting. The data is sourced from the Ergast API and stored in Azure Data Lake Gen2. We use Azure Databricks for data transformation and Azure Data Factory (ADF) to orchestrate the entire ETL process.
## Formula 1 Overview
Formula 1 (F1) is a global motorsport competition with teams and drivers competing in a series of races (Grands Prix) held on various circuits. Each season comprises 20-23 races, and each race contributes points to the Drivers’ and Constructors’ standings. The data from each race includes driver and team performance, lap times, pit stops, and qualifying results, all of which are valuable for analysis.
